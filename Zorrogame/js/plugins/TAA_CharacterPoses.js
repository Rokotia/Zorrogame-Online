 * Introduction
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * WARNING: This plugin requires RPG Maker MV 1.5.0 or above! Please make sure 
 * your RPG Maker MV software is up to date before using this plugin.
 * You don't need any specific version if you're using MZ.
 * 
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * When we want to create memorable cutscenes, we need stuff to happen onscreen,
 * not only a long sequence of messages with characters standing in place. Sometimes 
 * we need them to move around and behave like things are really happening there, and 
 * sometimes we need them to express themselves even more. Sometimes a simple movement 
 * of the head to agree or not what's being said, and sometimes even more complex 
 * behaviors like running, jumping, getting scared or simply acting different if left 
 * idle for too long.
 * 
 * You can get all of that by only using events, but if you're like me, going through 
 * a movement route window to configure the same patterns of animation over and over
 * again can get really tiring.
 * 
 * This plugin aims to make character animation easier, and faster to use. It will 
 * allow you to configure whole sets of animations for your actors and call it with 
 * a simple Plugin Command. It will also let you make characters blink, change sprites
 * when running and show a specific behavior when left idle for too long.
 * 
 * Plus, anything you can do for an actor can be done for NPCs using templates, or
 * setting up a new pattern with comments. Not to mention support for spritesheets
 * with more than three frames per direction!
 * 
 * =============================================================================
 * Instructions - Global Config
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * Global parameters are quite simple, and most of them are related to blinking:
 * 
 * Blink Interval
 *  - Defines the minimum amount of frames between each blink;
 * 
 * Blink Randomness
 *  - A random number between 0 and this value is added to the blink interval, adding
 *    a layer of randomness to character blinking. This way characters won't feel too
 *    robotic;
 * 
 * Blink Duration
 *  - Determines for how many frames blinking lasts;
 * 
 * Idle Wait Time
 *  - Determines for how many frames a character needs to stay still before triggering
 *    the idle pose automatically;
 * 
 * Balloon Poses
 *  - Defines if automatic balloon poses are enabled;
 * 
 * Check Files First
 *  - Defines if character sprite files existence are checked before loading. This can
 *    prevent the game from crashing when loading a new pose, but can lead to unexpected
 *    behaviors if the requested file is not available;
 * 
 * Enable 8 Directions
 *  - Defines if 8 direction movement and sprites are allowed;
 * 
 * Diagonal Event Trigger
 *  - Defines if an event set to trigger on player touch can be triggered by diagonal
 *    movements (which is not possible by default);
 * 
 * 8 Dir Layout
 *  - Defines the layout for the diagonal movement sprites. Diagonal sprites must always
 *    be present in the same sprite sheet as the default movement sets, and always below
 *    them. This parameter is used to set which row of sprites is used for each diagonal
 *    movement;
 * 
 * =============================================================================
 * Character Poses
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * A pose is a pattern for character animation, where we have a character spritesheet
 * file, an index to identify which set of frames to use (as by default each file
 * can contain one or eight characters at a time), a pattern defining how will sprites
 * alternate and how fast it should happen. Poses can be called using plugin commands,
 * defining how many times its pattern will be displayed or looping until another plugin
 * command is issued to restore the original pose.
 * 
 * There's also three special poses:
 *  - default: it's the one the character uses to walk around. If none is specified,
 *    the plugin will use the engine's default pattern;
 *  - dash: if configured, it will be automatically started when the character starts
 *    to run, and stopped when it turns to walking, or stop moving;
 *  - idle: if configured, is automatically triggered when the character stays still
 *    for more than "Idle Wait Time" frames;
 * 
 * To specify one of this reserved poses, you can just use the names above as Pose Keys,
 * or use plugin commands to define which key should be used in each case. Customizing
 * the reserved pose keys can also be useful if your characters needs to change sprites
 * in the middle of the game, like donning evil guards armor to infiltrate a castle,
 * for example.
 * 
 * Pose setup for actors are done exclusively through plugin parameters. For events, you
 * can setup pose templates, to create a library and pick the patterns you want for each
 * event. You can also define default poses patterns that are automatically applied to
 * all events, or create a custom pose for a single event using event comments.
 * 
 * TIP: For better performance of your game, try to group character poses in as few files
 * as possible. The plugin will always preload character files to not risk "flickering"
 * when changing poses. If poses are scattered through many files more memory ends up
 * being used. So, the fewer files you use, the less consumed memory!
 * 
 * WARNING: When loading pose parameters for actors, or trying to load poses for events,
 * the plugin will always check if the filename specified exists. If it doesn't, the
 * pose is discarded. This helps to prevent game crashes.
 * 
 * =============================================================================
 * More Frames
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * The plugin supports spritesheets with more than the default three frames per character
 * direction. To make use of it, the character image filename must contain a specific 
 * pattern identifying how many frames are in the file:
 *      character_sprites[f<n>].png
 * Where <n> is the number of frames. For example, for a character with eight frames
 * animations, a filename would be character_sprites[f8].png.
 * 
 * =============================================================================
 * 8 Directions Sprites
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * The plugin supports 8 directions sprites and movement. The feature must be manually
 * enabled in the plugin parameters, and the character image filename must contain a
 * specific pattern to identify the file as having diagonal sprites:
 *      character_sprites[d8].png
 * This can be used with more frames, just add both tags to the file name:
 *      character_sprites[f8][d8].png
 * 
 * WARNING: Swapping from one 8 directional pose to a 4 direction, or vice versa, while
 * the character is moving (or an animated pose is playing) can lead to unexpected sprite
 * behavior. If possible, avoid this scenario.
 * 
 * =============================================================================
 * Pose Setup - Actor Poses
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * Actor poses are setup individually, creating individual libraries that can be
 * easily accessed later through plugin commands. Each actor must have a single entry.
 * If an actor ID is configured more than once, only the first entry is considered.
 * 
 * Actor ID
 *  - ID for the actor the poses apply to;
 * 
 * Default Blink Sprites
 *  - If you don't want to setup a default pose but want to setup blinking, use this
 *    parameter to select the spritesheet to use when the character has its eyes closed.
 *    This parameter gets overwritten if a 'default' pose is specified. If you don't want
 *    to use the blinking feature, just leave this parameter blank.
 * 
 * Default Blink Index
 *  - If you don't want to setup a default pose but want to setup blinking, use this
 *    parameter to define the index on the spritesheet for your character. This 
 *    parameter gets overwritten if a 'default' pose is specified.
 * 
 * For each actor pose, the following parameters are presented:
 * 
 * Pose Key
 *  - This is the name of the pose, and what you'll use to trigger it later. This must
 *    be unique for each character, and is case sensitive. Do not start pose names with
 *    special characters like @ or #;
 * 
 * Spritesheet
 *  - The character spritesheet to use for this pose. This parameter must be set with
 *    an image from the img/characters directory containing the desired character sprites,
 *    otherwise the pose is discarded;
 * 
 * Spritesheet Index
 *  - Identifies which character sheet to use from the spritesheet. It starts on 0 for the
 *    upper left character, growing up to 7 for the lower right character. Here's a visual
 *    example, where each letter represents sprites from a character:
 *          a a a b b b c c c d d d
 *          a a a b b b c c c d d d
 *          a a a b b b c c c d d d
 *          a a a b b b c c c d d d
 *          e e e f f f g g g h h h
 *          e e e f f f g g g h h h
 *          e e e f f f g g g h h h
 *          e e e f f f g g g h h h
 *    In this example, character a has index 0, b index 1, c is 2, d is 3, e is 4 all the 
 *    way to h, which is 7.
 *    If your spritesheet has a single character (files with names starting with $) then
 *    the index will always be 0;
 * 
 * Blink Spritesheet
 *  - The character spritesheet to use when the character blinks while in this pose.
 *    If you don't want the blinking feature for this pose, simply leave this parameter
 *    blank;
 * 
 * Blink Index
 *  - Identify which character sheet to use from the blinking spritesheet;
 * 
 * Pattern
 *  - Set a custom pattern for how to alternate sprites from the spritesheet and 
 *    display a pose. If left blank, the engine default pattern is used.
 *    A pattern can be a sequence of numbers, referencing the sprite index in a
 *    spritesheet (starting on 0) and maintaining its direction, or include text 
 *    codes to use change to any sprite direction. See the diagram below as an example:
 * 
 *               0   1   2
 *      down    \o   o   o/                 up = 8
 *      left     d   o   d          left = 4    right = 6
 *      right    b   o   b                 down = 2
 *      up       o/  o  \o
 * 
 *    So, in a character spritesheet with 3 frames for each direction, you have indexes
 *    from 0 to 2. But if you want to set a pose to, for example, play an animation while
 *    the character spins in place, you can define a pattern for it like: d4, d8, d6, d2
 *    This pattern will simply make the character change directions, assuming 2 as down,
 *    4 as left, 8 as up and 6 as right. You can also change direction and the index at
 *    the same frame time by using the letter "i": d4, d8i2, d6i0, d2i1. Just always
 *    remember to place the code for direction before the code for index (never use
 *    i2d6, for example)!
 *    WARNING: When setting patterns that use sprites from multiple directions try to inform
 *    direction for all pattern instances to prevent glitches when changing poses. For example,
 *    for a pattern like 'd2i0, d2i1, d2i2', refrain from setting 'd2i0, 1, 2'. Although it
 *    works, this can cause strange behaviors when changing from one pose to another.
 * 
 * Speed
 *  - This determines how fast will the pose be, by setting the number of frames to wait
 *    before iterating the pattern array and changing sprites. So, the lower the number,
 *    the faster it will be (less frames before jumping to the next sprite).
 * 
 * =============================================================================
 * Pose Setup - Poses Templates
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * Pose templates are used for events. Despite having a similar structure, the following
 * parameters have a different behavior:
 * 
 * Default Blink Sprites
 *  - Here you won't select a file, but instead define a pattern so the plugin can look
 *    for the right file at runtime. You can set it as the same file the event is
 *    configured with the tag %{char}, or complement it with a specific pattern, like
 *    %{char}_blink. In this example, if the event is using People1 for the character,
 *    the plugin will try to load People1_blink for blinking. If the file don't exist,
 *    the animation will be aborted to prevent a game crash;
 * 
 * Default Blink Index
 *  - This parameter is treated as an eval, and you can reference the character index
 *    used by the event with the tag %{index}. So, if you have spritesheets built in a
 *    way that the first row of characters have open eyes, and the second have closed
 *    eyes (for blinking), you can setup this index as %{index}+4, for example. In this
 *    case, an event that uses sprites from index 0 (which is the upper left character)
 *    will use its blinking sprites from with index 4, which is the lower left character;
 * 
 * Spritesheet
 *  - This works similarly to Default Blink Sprites;
 * 
 * Spritesheet Index
 *  - This works similarly to Default Blink Index;
 * 
 * Blink Spritesheet
 *  - This works the same as previous sprite parameters, but with an additional tag:
 *    use %{pose} to reference the Spritesheet parameter value;
 * 
 * Blink Index
 *  - This works the same as previous index parameters, but with an additional tag: use
 *    %{pIndex} for the Spritesheet Index value;
 * 
 * Speed
 *  - Works the same as for actors, but this parameter overwrites the engine move speed
 *    config in the move route and event page configs. For reference, here are the 
 *    equivalents (considering normal frequency):
 *      + 8x slower = 24
 *      + 4x slower = 21
 *      + 2x slower = 18
 *      + Normal = 15
 *      + 2x faster = 12
 *      + 4x faster = 9
 * 
 * WARNING: As template setup do not reference a file directly, but instead defines a 
 * filename pattern to look for them at runtime, we cannot mark the files as used for 
 * when exporting your game with the option to "Exclude Unused Files". So be careful 
 * when using this feature, as you'll probably have to manually copy the files into the 
 * exported project, or create dummy events using them to trick the engine. I'm still
 * thinking on ways to make it easier to manage.
 * 
 * 
 * =============================================================================
 * Pose Setup - Default Pose Templates
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * Default pose templates is simply a list of Pose Keys that should be automatically
 * loaded for all events. The keys referenced here should be properly configured as
 * pose templates for them to work. Keep in mind that Pose Keys are case sensitive.
 * 
 * So, Pose Templates needs to be loaded into events through notes or comment tags,
 * while Default Pose Templates are always loaded into all events, unless explicitly
 * stated otherwise through notes or comment tags.
 * 
 * =============================================================================
 * Pose Setup - Balloon Poses
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * Balloon poses, when configured, are automatically triggered with a balloon 
 * animation. Setup includes a few familiar parameters:
 *  - Balloon ID, identifying the balloon for which the pose refers to. Common ID
 *    values are:
 *      + 1: Exclamation
 *      + 2: Question
 *      + 3: Music Note
 *      + 4: Heart
 *      + 5: Anger
 *      + 6: Sweat
 *      + 7: Cobweb
 *      + 8: Silence
 *      + 9: Light bulb
 *      + 10: Zzz
 *      + 11 or higher: user defined balloons
 *  - Spritesheet, Index, Pattern and Speed, which works similarly to pose setups.
 * 
 * The one thing different here is that if Pattern is set as an empty array,
 * the plugin will simply swap sprites maintaining the character direction and
 * sprite index. However, if a custom pattern is set, the plugin will play it
 * while the balloon is playing. The character will automatically fallback to its
 * previous pose when the balloon stops playing.
 * 
 * =============================================================================
 * Setting up Events
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * There's three ways to setup poses for events: using the event note to load pose
 * templates; loading pose templates using comments (so that it affects only the 
 * current event page); or build a new pose using event comments.
 * 
 * Using Event Note
 * ----------------
 * 
 * To load a list of pose templates and make them available for an event, you can add
 * the following tag to its note field:
 *      <TAA_CP: lib:pose1,pose2,pose3,...,poseN>
 * 
 * You can also customize the event reserved poses directly from the notes:
 *      <TAA_CP: default:pose1, dash:pose2, idle:pose3, lib:pose4,pose5,...,poseN>
 * 
 * The list of common poses should always use a tag (lib) so the plugin can identify 
 * what is what.
 * 
 * You can use tags to load balloon pose templates as well:
 *      <TAA_CP: balloons:x,y,z...,n>
 * List balloon poses by its corresponding balloon ID.
 * 
 * There's two more possible note tags. The first is shown below, and it's used to 
 * prevent the event from loading default poses (configured in the Plugin Manager):
 *      <TAA_CP: noDefaults>
 * The other is used to enable automatic saving of the event pose setup, so that the 
 * event will remember it if the player leaves the map and come back. This note can be 
 * overwritten with event comments:
 *      <TAA_CP: savePose:true>
 * 
 * You can combine tags as you like, just remember to separate them with a comma.
 * 
 * Starting on version 1.3.3, a new tag can be used to enable or disable character poses
 * on events:
 *      <TAA_CP: enable:true>
 *      <TAA_CP: enable:false>
 * 
 * Setting this tag to false won't prevent poses from being loaded into the event, but 
 * it will prevent any poses from working on the event unless it is enabled through a 
 * plugin command or comment tag. If nothing is specified, the plugin will assume poses 
 * are enabled.
 * 
 * Using Event Comments
 * --------------------
 * 
 * First of all, you don't need to fit everything in a single comment command, as they're
 * quite limited on the number of lines they can handle.
 * 
 * Regardless of using the commands to load a pose, or create a new one, you need to
 * use the <TAA_CP> tag to start setting up poses, and </TAA_CP> to end it (or else the
 * plugin will go through the rest of the event page looking for the ending tag).
 * 
 * After starting the tag, the following commands can be included to create a pose for
 * that specific event page (use one line for each command):
 *
 *  cpLoad:pose1,pose2,...,poseN
 *      - defines a list of pose templates to load into the event;
 * 
 *  cpLoad:reservedKey:poseKey
 *      - you can also customize the events reserved poses through comments. In this 
 *        pattern, reservedKey can be either default, dash or idle, and poseKey is the
 *        pose template to set it to.
 *        This clause can also be used to load balloon templates, like the example below:
 *            cpLoad:balloon:1,2,4
 * 
 *  cpNewPose:poseName
 *      - to start creating a new pose, use this command, where poseName is the Pose Key
 *        to use. Remember, it must be unique.
 *  cpNewBalloonPose:balloonId
 *      - to start creating a new balloon pose, use this command. Remember, balloonId must
 *        be unique, you can't create two balloon poses for the same balloon. You can use
 *        Plugin Commands to alter it if you need though.
 * 
 *  cpSprite:file,index
 *      - it must be used after the cpNewPose. It defines the Spritesheet and Index
 *        pose parameters. file must be the character filename to use, and index is
 *        the character index from the file;
 *        This is used for both creating a new pose and a new balloon pose.
 * 
 *  cpBlinkSprite:file,index
 *      - quite similar to cpSprite, only to define the blinking sprites. You can
 *        omit this command if blinking is not required for the pose;
 * 
 *  cpSpeed:number
 *      - defines how fast the pattern will be played. Its the number of frames to wait
 *        before changing sprites;
 *        This is used for both creating a new pose and a new balloon pose.
 * 
 *  cpPattern:patternList
 *      - its a comma separated list for the custom pattern to use for this pose. You can
 *        omit this if you want the engine's default pattern;
 *        This is used for both creating a new pose and a new balloon pose.
 * 
 *  :cpEndPose:
 *      - use this to tell the plugin that the pose setup has ended. If this command is
 *        not included the plugin will ignore the rest and discard the pose.
 *        This is used for both creating a new pose and a new balloon pose.
 *  
 *  cpAutoSave:true|false
 *      - enables / disables auto saving on the event pose setup
 * 
 * Here's an example on how to use this comment commands:
 * 
 * <TAA_CP>
 * cpLoad:pose1,pose2
 * cpNewPose:spin
 * cpSprite:%{char},%{index}
 * cpBlinkSprite:%{pose}_blink,%{pIndex}
 * cpSpeed:5
 * cpPattern:d4,d8,d6,d2
 * :cpEndPose:
 * </TAA_CP>
 * 
 * As of version 1.2.4, two new tags have been included:
 *  cpDeletePose:poseKey
 *      - This can be effectively used to delete a pose when switching to an event page
 *        to another. One situation that can be useful, for example, is if you setup a
 *        custom idle pose in one page, but want to disable it in the following page.
 *        You can delete the pose when it is no longer needed.
 *        If for some reason you try to delete a default pose, the plugin will 
 *        automatically replace it with a generic default pose, preventing eventual 
 *        crashes;
 * 
 *  cpDeleteBalloonPose:balloonId
 *      - This one is similar pretty similar to the former one. The difference here is
 *        that it can be used to delete a balloon pose instead;
 * 
 * As of version 1.3.3, two new tag has been included:
 *  cpEnable:true|false
 *      - This can be used to enable or disable character poses when the event page is 
 *        triggered. You can change this setting later with plugin commands;
 * 
 *  :cpReset:
 *      - This discards all previous poses loaded into the event and recreates its 
 *        library. All default poses and note tags are reprocessed. Comment tags
 *        on the page AFTER this one are also processed, so try to have this as your
 *        first comment tag command when using it. Any comment tag loaded on the page
 *        before this is discarded.
 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * Script Calls
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * $gameSystem.setPose(id, poseKey)
 *  - sets poseKey as the current pose, but do not animate if the character is not 
 *    moving. id can refer to either an actor, or an event:
 *      + Use 0 for the party leader;
 *      + Use -1, -2, and -3 for a follower;
 *      + Any number starting in 1 will be considered an event. If the event is found
 *        in the current map, sets its pose to poseKey.
 * 
 * $gameSystem.setAnimatedPose(id, poseKey, cycles)
 *  - sets poseKey as the current pose and automatically starts playing its animation
 *    pattern. If cycles is present, it defines how many times the animation cycle
 *    will be played before resetting to default. If it is omitted, the animation pattern
 *    will repeat until a new pose is set;
 * 
 * $gameSystem.setDefaultPose(id, poseKey)
 *  - changes the actor or event default pose to poseKey.
 * 
 * $gameSystem.setDashPose(id, poseKey)
 *  - changes the actor or event dash pose to poseKey.
 * 
 * $gameSystem.setIdlePose(id, poseKey)
 *  - changes the actor or event idle pose to poseKey.
 * 
 * $gameSystem.restorePose(id)
 *  - restores the actor or event to its previous used pose.
 * 
 * $gameSystem.restoreAllActorsPoses()
 *  - restore all actors to their previous poses.
 * 
 * $gameSystem.resetPose(id)
 *  - resets the actor or event to its default pose.
 * 
 * $gameSystem.resetAllActorPoses()
 *  - resets all actors to their default poses.
 * 
 * $gameSystem.isPoseAvailable(id, poseKey)
 *  - returns true if poseKey exists for the specified actor or event;
 * 
 * $gameSystem.poseHasCustomPattern(id, poseKey)
 *  - returns true if poseKey for the specified actor or event has a custom pattern setup;
 * 
 * $gameSystem.getCurrentPose(id)

 * 
 * $gameSystem.getIdlePose(id)
 *  - returns the current idle pose key for the specified actor or event;
 * 
 * $gameSystem.getCurrentPoseSpeed(id)
 *  - returns the current pose speed for the specified actor or event;
 * 
 * $gameSystem.enableIde(id)
 *  - enable idle pose for the character. When enabled, as soon as the character stays
 *    still for enough time the idle pose is triggered.
 * 
 * $gameSystem.enablePartyIdle()
 *  - enable idle pose for the entire party at the same time.
 * 
 * $gameSystem.disableIdle(id)
 *  - disable idle pose for the character. When disabled, the character won't start the
 *    idle pose, regardless of how long it stays still.
 * 
 * $gameSystem.disablePartyIdle()
 *  - disable idle pose for the entire party at the same time.
 * 
 * $gameSystem.isIdleEnabled(id)
 *  - returns true if the idle pose is enabled for the character, or false if it is
 *    disabled. It doesn't evaluate if the idle pose is present.

 *      + Any number starting in 1 will be considered an event. If the event is found
 *        in the current map, sets its pose to poseKey.
 * 
 * SetAnimatedPose target poseKey
 *  - sets poseKey as the current pose and automatically starts playing its animation
 *    pattern. If cycles is present, it defines how many times the animation cycle
 *    will be played before resetting to default. If it is omitted, the animation pattern
 *    will repeat until a new pose is set;
 * 
 * SetDefaultPose target poseKey
 *  - changes the target's default pose to poseKey.

 *    for specific actors or events.
 * 
 * RestorePose target
 *  - restores the target to its previous used pose. If you want to restore poses for
 *    all actors, set target to 'actors', or 'party'. Use numbers to run it for specific
 *    actors or events.
 * 
 * ResetPose target
 *  - resets the target to its default pose. If you want to reset poses for all actors, 
 *    set target to 'actors', or 'party'. Use numbers to run it for specific actors or 
 *    events.
 * 
 * SaveEventPoses eventId
 *  - stores the current event pose setup so that it is restored the next time the event
 *    is loaded (like going out, than back to the map). It is run ON THE CURRENT MAP. 
 *    Always.
 * 
 * DeleteEventPoses mapId eventId
 *  - if an event pose setup has been saved for the informed map, its data is deleted.
 *    The next time the event is loaded it will start poses from scratch. Can be triggered
 *    from any map to any map.

 *  - Enable or disable character poses for an event located in the current map.
 * 
 * BalloonPose set id balloonId poseKey
 *  - replaces a balloon pose based on a configured pose, identified by the poseKey.

 *    balloonId is not present, restore all balloon poses for the character.
 * 
 * BalloonPose enable id
 * BalloonPose on id
 * BalloonPose allow id
 *  - enables automatic balloon poses for the specified character.
 * 
 * BalloonPose disable id
 * BalloonPose off id
 * BalloonPose block id
 *  - disables automatic balloon poses for the specified character.
 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * Plugin Commands (MZ)
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * Set Character Pose
 *  - Change the character pose. It has the following parameters:
 *      + Command Target: Apply to either an actor or an event;
 *      + Char ID: If the target is an actor, specify the character party index.
 *        If it's an event, specify the event id;
 *      + Is Animated: if true, trigger the pose animation even if the character is
 *        not moving. If false, animations are only displayed if it moves;
 *      + Animation Cycles: If the pose is animated, specify how many times the
 *        pattern cycle will be played. If left as 0 the pattern will be played
 *        indefinitely, until the pose is changed again.
 * 
 * Set Reserved Pose
 *  - Change the characters reserved poses. The parameters "Command Target" and "Char ID"
 *    works the same as the previous command. The following parameters are also applied:
 *      + Pose Type: specify which reserved pose to alter (default, dash or idle);
 *      + New Pose: specify the reserved pose new pose key;
 *      + Change and Trigger: if true, change the reserved pose and trigger it at the
 *        same time. If false, the reserved pose will be changed, but the current pose
 *        will be sustained;
 * 
 * Idle Pose Settings
 *  - Allows you to enable or disable a character's idle pose.
 * 
 * Balloon Pose Settings
 *  - Allows you to enable or disable a character's balloon poses.
 * 
 * Change Balloon Poses
 *  - Allows you to change a character balloon pose. You need to specify for which balloon
 *    to apply the change, and a pose key to use as reference for the change.
 * 
 * Reset Poses
 *  - Allows you to reset the character's pose setup to its default. It can affect balloon
 *    poses (Balloon Poses) or triggerable poses (Pose Library).
 * 
 * Restore Poses
 *  - Allows you to revert a character's to its previous pose.
 * 
 * Event Pose Library
 *  - Allows you to force an event to save its pose library state, reload or delete a saved
 *    pose library.
 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * Changelog
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Version 0.5.0:
 *  - Beta release
 * Version 0.6.0:
 *  - New plugin commands and script calls:
 *      + Enable / disable idle poses for characters
 *      + Save / delete / reload event poses, to persist triggered poses if the player
 *        leaves the map
 *  - New note and comment tags to enable/disable auto save on event poses
 *  - Fixed a bug that caused blinking NPCs to remain with eyes closed "forever"
 * Version 0.7.0:
 *  - Added Balloon Poses for actors, templates and event defaults
 *  - Added Plugin Commands and Script Calls for balloons
 *  - Added a parameter to disable balloons entirely (for compatibility purposes)
 * Version 1.0.0:
 *  - First stable release
 * Version 1.1.0:
 *  - MZ compatibility;
 *  - Fixed a bug on starting the idle pose after a balloon pose;
 *  - Fixed some bugs on poses using frames from multiple directions;
 *  - Fixed a bug on walking poses;
 *  - Changed caching behavior to better use cached character files;
 * Version 1.2.0:
 *  - Fixed an issue with MZ Plugin Commands;
 *  - Updated the help section describing MZ Plugin Commands;
 *  - Added script calls to get current idle and dash pose keys;
 *  - Added functions to check if idle and balloon poses are enabled;
 *  - Added a failsafe to prevent balloon poses getting stuck when a balloon pose
 *    is triggered while another one is playing;
 *  - Fixed an issue when leaving the idle pose directly for the dash pose, which
 *    could mess up the default walking pose;
 *  - A few changes to the help section;
 * Version 1.2.1:
 *  - Reworked character spritesheet caching to fix a bug crashing the game on save.
 * Version 1.2.2:
 *  - Fixed an issue when changing an event to an empty page (with no poses loaded),
 *    which would cause the old sprite to remain onscreen
 *  - Fixed an issue which would crash the game if using the "Erase Event" command.
 * Version 1.2.3:
 *  - Fixed an issue that would cause game crash if none of the event pages conditions
 *    are met (for example, have an event with a single page to load only when switch 1
 *    is ON. If it is OFF, the game would crash);
 * Version 1.2.4:
 *  - Fixed a compatibility issue that could cause a crash when entering battle test;
 *  - Fixed a bug that could cause crashes with deployed projects (failure to load image
 *    files);
 *  - Fixed a bug that could cause an event to not have a default pose. So if you setup
 *    an idle pose using comments, for example, the event won't have any way of coming
 *    out of the idle pattern;
 *  - Added two new comment tags:
 *      + cpDeletePose, to delete a pose when switching from one event page to another
 *        (for example, to delete an idle pose that's no longer required);
 *      + cpDeleteBalloonPose, to delete a balloon pose when switching from one event
 *        page to another;
 * Version 1.3.0:
 *  - Reworked the entire character caching method, fixing caching issues that could cause
 *    sprites to disappear when the player is transferred to another map in MZ;
 *  - Changed method that checks if image file exists before trying to load so it can
 *    work properly on web and mobile deployments;
 *  - Added a new parameter to enable / disable checking if files exists before loading;
 *  - Added 8 directions movement and sprite support;
 *      * There's a known issue here. Changing from 8 directions sprites to 4 directions
 *        while a character is moving (for example, from walking to dashing sprites) can
 *        cause weird effects which I don't intend to fix anytime soon, since that transition
 *        doesn't seem to make much sense to me!
 * Version 1.3.1:
 *  - Fixed an issue that could crash the game if 8 directions was not enabled;
 *  - Fixed compatibility with YEP_X_CoreUpdatesOpt. Keep in mind that this fix required
 *    me to completely rewrite the ImageManager.loadNormalBitmap function to restore engine
 *    default, as Yanfly's version changed core variable names that clashes with my code.
 *    That also means that new compatibility issues could arise with other plugins if they
 *    try to extend this function further. To avoid such issues, I recommend placing 
 *    TAA_CharacterPoses right below YEP_X_CoreUpdatesOpt, and as high as you can in your 
 *    game's plugin list!
 * Version 1.3.2:
 *  - Fixed a bug that could mess path finding with 8 directions disabled;
 * Version 1.3.3:
 *  - Fixed a bug that could cause the game to crash if the party leader has no poses
 *    configured in the Plugin Manager
 *  - Fixed a bug that would break the engine function to hide followers. Followers would
 *    always be visible, no exception;
 *  - Fixed a bug that would cause an erased event to remain onscreen;
 *  - Added note and comment tags to enable / disable character poses for an event;
 *  - Added comment tags to reset the event pose library when initializing a new event page;
 *  - Added script calls and plugin commands to enable / disable character poses for an
 *    event in the current map;
 * Version 1.3.4:
 *  - Fixed a bug that would cause the followers dash pose to not work as intended;
 * Version 1.3.5:
 *  - Added support to MV and MZ image encryption when using the Check Files First parameter;
 * Version 1.3.6:
 *  - Fixed a small bug that could cause wrong sprites to be displayed when changing between
 *    two poses;
 *  - Some minor code refactoring, no other changes in functionality;
